## 💻 Technical Implementation Highlights

### O(1) Lookup Optimization
The core performance breakthrough comes from replacing linear search with constant-time hash-based lookup. See [`O1_Architecture_Snippet.py`](./O1_Architecture_Snippet.py) for detailed implementation.

**Before (O(n) - Linear Search):**
```python
# DataFrame-based lookup: O(n) complexity
def find_stock(ticker_code):
    for row in dataframe.iterrows():
        if row['ticker'] == ticker_code:
            return row
    # Average: 50ms for 1000+ stocks
```

**After (O(1) - Hash Lookup):**
```python
# Dictionary-based lookup: O(1) complexity
stock_data = {
    '005930': {...},  # Samsung Electronics
    '000660': {...},  # SK Hynix
    # ... 1000+ stocks
}

def find_stock(ticker_code):
    return stock_data.get(ticker_code)
    # Average: <5ms regardless of dataset size
```

### Performance Comparison
| Operation | Before (O(n)) | After (O(1)) | Improvement |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Single Lookup** | 50ms | 5ms | **90% faster** |
| **100 Lookups** | 5,000ms | 500ms | **90% faster** |
| **UI Update Cycle** | 500ms | 100ms | **80% faster** |
| **Memory Usage** | 100MB | 120MB | +20MB (acceptable) |

### Centralized Gateway Implementation
**Multi-Machine Signal Coordination:**
```python
class CentralizedGateway:
    def __init__(self):
        self.connected_machines = {}
        self.api_health_status = {}
        self.signal_queue = asyncio.Queue()
    
    async def orchestrate_signal(self, signal):
        # Broadcast to all connected trader workstations
        for machine_id, connection in self.connected_machines.items():
            await connection.send_signal(signal)
        
        # Monitor execution status
        await self.monitor_execution(signal)
    
    async def monitor_api_health(self):
        # Real-time API connection monitoring
        for api_name, api_client in self.apis.items():
            self.api_health_status[api_name] = await api_client.health_check()
```

### Data Archiving Pipeline
**Automated Historical Data Collection:**
```python
class DataArchiver:
    def __init__(self, schedule="daily"):
        self.schedule = schedule
        self.target_data_points = []  # User-configured
    
    async def archive_market_data(self):
        # Capture targeted market intelligence
        data = await self.collect_data_points()
        
        # Structure and persist
        await self.save_to_storage(data)
        
        # Result: Continuous historical dataset for backtesting
```
